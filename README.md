## üì• Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/absalem42/tool.git
cd tool
```

2. Run the install script:
```bash
chmod +x install
./install
```

The install script will:
- Check for Docker installation
- Start Docker if not running
- Build the security-tools image
- Optionally add scripts to your PATH

### Manual Install

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x build start stop run bgnd install

# Build the Docker image
./build
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Starting the Container

Navigate to your work directory and start the container:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/work
./start
```

This starts an interactive shell with your current directory mounted at `/home/security/work`.

### Running in Background

To run the container in the background:

```bash
./bgnd
```

### Executing Commands

Execute commands in a running container:

```bash
./run <command>
```

### Stopping the Container

```bash
./stop
```

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Web Fuzzing with ffuf

**Basic directory fuzzing:**
```bash
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt
```

**Fuzzing with extensions:**
```bash
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt -e .php,.html,.txt
```

**POST data fuzzing:**
```bash
ffuf -u http://target.com/login -X POST -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" -w /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt
```

**Using the fuzz alias (colored output):**
```bash
fuzz -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt
```

### Directory Busting with gobuster

**Basic directory enumeration:**
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt
```

**With specific extensions:**
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt -x php,html,txt
```

**DNS subdomain enumeration:**
```bash
gobuster dns -d target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt
```

**With threads for faster scanning:**
```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt -t 50
```

### Web Fuzzing with wfuzz

**Basic fuzzing:**
```bash
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt http://target.com/FUZZ
```

**Filter by status code:**
```bash
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt --hc 404 http://target.com/FUZZ
```

**POST parameter fuzzing:**
```bash
wfuzz -w /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ" http://target.com/login
```

### Password Cracking with John the Ripper

**Crack a password hash:**
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt hash.txt
```

**Crack with specific format:**
```bash
john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt hash.txt
```

**Show cracked passwords:**
```bash
john --show hash.txt
```

**Crack with rules:**
```bash
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt --rules hash.txt
```

### Password Cracking with hashcat

**Basic MD5 cracking:**
```bash
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt --force
```

**SHA256 cracking:**
```bash
hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

**NTLM hash cracking:**
```bash
hashcat -m 1000 -a 0 hash.txt /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt --force
```

**Show cracked hashes:**
```bash
hashcat -m 0 hash.txt --show
```

**Common hash modes:**
- `-m 0` - MD5
- `-m 100` - SHA1
- `-m 1000` - NTLM
- `-m 1400` - SHA256
- `-m 1800` - sha512crypt (Unix)
- `-m 3200` - bcrypt

## üìù Adding Custom Wordlists

### Method 1: Copy Files to Container

While the container is running:

```bash
# From your host machine
docker cp /path/to/your/wordlist.txt security-tools:/usr/share/wordlists/custom.txt
```

### Method 2: Mount a Wordlist Directory

Modify the start script or run with custom mount:

```bash
docker run -it --name security-tools --rm \
  -v "$PWD:/home/security/work" \
  -v "/path/to/wordlists:/usr/share/custom-wordlists" \
  security-tools "/bin/zsh"
```

### Method 3: Add to Dockerfile

Edit the Dockerfile and add your wordlist during build:

```dockerfile
COPY my-wordlist.txt /usr/share/wordlists/my-wordlist.txt
```

Then rebuild:
```bash
./build
```

### Method 4: Download During Runtime

From inside the container:

```bash
cd /usr/share/wordlists
wget https://example.com/wordlist.txt
```

## üîß Common Commands

### Container Management

```bash
# Build the container
./build

# Start interactive shell
./start

# Run in background
./bgnd

# Execute command in running container
./run ls -la

# Stop and remove container
./stop
```

### Built-in Aliases

The container includes these helpful aliases:

```bash
ll        # ls -lah - Detailed file listing
fuzz      # ffuf -c - Colored ffuf output
```

### Wordlist Locations

```bash
# List available wordlists
ls -lh /usr/share/wordlists/

# View wordlist contents
cat /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt
head -20 /usr/share/wordlists/passwords.txt
```

### Working with Files

Your host's current directory is mounted at `/home/security/work`:

```bash
# From inside container
cd /home/security/work

# Save output to your host
ffuf -u http://target.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/web-common.txt -o scan-results.txt

# Files saved here persist on your host machine
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Docker Not Running

**Issue:** `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`

**Solution:**
```bash
# On macOS
open -a Docker

# On Linux
sudo systemctl start docker

# Verify Docker is running
docker ps
```

### Container Won't Start

**Issue:** Container name already in use

**Solution:**
```bash
# Stop and remove existing container
./stop

# Or manually
docker stop security-tools
docker rm security-tools
```

### Permission Denied on Scripts

**Issue:** `Permission denied` when running scripts

**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x build start stop run bgnd install
```

### hashcat: No devices found

**Issue:** hashcat shows no devices

**Solution:** This is expected! The container runs hashcat in CPU mode only (with `--force` flag). No GPU is required or configured.

```bash
# Always use --force flag with hashcat
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt wordlist.txt --force
```

### Container Runs Out of Space

**Issue:** Not enough disk space

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clean up Docker images and containers
docker system prune -a

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune
```

### Cannot Find Wordlists

**Issue:** Wordlist not found error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify wordlist location inside container
ls -la /usr/share/wordlists/

# If empty, rebuild the container
./build
```

### Changes Don't Persist

**Issue:** Files disappear after stopping container

**Solution:** Save all work in `/home/security/work` which is mounted from your host:

```bash
cd /home/security/work
# Save your files here
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building from Source

The Dockerfile builds the container with these steps:

1. **Base Image**: Debian Bookworm Slim
2. **System Tools**: git, curl, wget, python3, golang, nano, zsh
3. **Security Tools**: john, hashcat, dirb
4. **Binary Tools**: ffuf, gobuster (downloaded from GitHub releases)
5. **Python Tools**: wfuzz (via pip)
6. **Wordlists**: Custom minimal wordlists for quick testing
7. **Shell Config**: Zsh with custom prompt and aliases

Build time: ~15-20 seconds (after Docker layer caching)

## üìú Scripts Reference
